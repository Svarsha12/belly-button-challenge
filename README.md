##Background

In this assignment, you will build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset Links to an external site., which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.
The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.
Before You Begin

Create a new repository for this project called belly-button-challenge. Do not add this Challenge to an existing repository.
Clone the new repository to your computer.
Inside your local git repository, copy the files from in the StarterCode folder contained within the Module 14 Challenge zip file. i.e. index.html, samples.json, and the static folder.

##Files

Download the following files to help you get started:
Module 14 Challenge files Links to an external site.
Instructions

Complete the following steps:
Use the D3 library to read in samples.json from the URL https://static.bc-edx.com/data/dl-1-2/m14/lms/starter/samples.json.
Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.
Use sample_values as the values for the bar chart.
Use otu_ids as the labels for the bar chart.
Use otu_labels as the hovertext for the chart.
